`The philosophical ideals populated by [Ayn Rand] that a man (or woman) is only entitled to what he has earned.  It also promotes the [right] to life, a life free from carrying the burden of others.  It deplores racism as being "the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism."  It promotes the idea that life "can be kept in existence only by a process of self-sustaining action" and therefore a person cannot live a life of stagnation as a [second-hander]. It states that one loves another for their virtues, and not their character flaws.  It promotes rational and fair thought above all else, "A man is to be judged by the judgments he pronounces."  It stresses pure morality as a supreme goal even though it’s difficult.  It denounces force as a means to make a man do anything.  All actions require the voluntary consent of those involved. It states that the purpose of the government is to protect men from criminals, protect men from foreign invaders, and to settle disputes according to objective laws. It promotes [capitalism] as the best system thus far because it "entails a constant process of motion, growth and progress."  It supports the idea that sex should only be shared between two people who fully accept each other.  And if this is taken as seriously as it is meant to be, it is a stricter limitation than that set forth by religion as it is practically a miracle that you find some that you fully accept.  Suggested reading: [The Virtue of Selfishness] (where the above quotes are taken from), [Atlas Shrugged], and [The Fountainhead] (though she has written many other works).`

Aptly stands for 'Super Tan Girl'; a combination of a Gina and Valley Girl into one entity. Usually blonde, but is based on the overexcessive and obvious fake bake the girl has undergone. Also associated with the more popular crowd, but not necessarily meaning that they are. "Do you think that she went on vacation?"

***guild*** is the programming term for a discord server. It is not used anywhere else.

because I need to feel superior to you
%
exactly what I'm thinking
%
what?
%
if triggering is a synonym to annoying in your mind, why would you corrrect me?
%
triggering*
%
it has a high chance of annoying someone
%
owen
%
it isn't a true 9/11 meme
%
I don't think the twin towers one is too edgy
%
I won't post anyting pornographic or outright offensive
%
i.e. the twin towers thing
%
ok
%
please
%
or edgy
%
yea ok
%
assuming its not porn right?
%
not anything nsfw
%
So I can post them in <#350487103613698048>?
%
i.e. these "memes"
%
I made <#350487103613698048> for spam/spam-like objects
%
no?
%
make a meme channel then
%
I am mentally scared
%
so yes
%
it's not creative or interesting, just irritating
%
does it mentally scar you?
%
what?
%
stop sending it

%
apparently
%
I see
%
censorship = middle school
%
does it trigger you?

are you still mentally trapped in middle school?

this one is bad too
%
honestly how is the other one so bad?
%
I can't interpret a dependent clause alone

it's probably like that in rust too

console.log(v)

man sshd says "OpenSSH SSH daemon"
%
am confused

to something
%
apparently I converted a month ago for some reason
%
but previously used sshd
%
is there another one?
%
turns out i'm using openssh
%
I do see logs from sshd in journalctl
%
sounds like it might not exist
%
is there one?
%
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
%
where is the sshd log file
%
...
%
🤔
%
eric I'm really confused
%
I'm rebooting remote
%
the last entry in the log file is dated October 31
%
the main issue is that it isn't writing to the log file
%
nvm maybe

Eric's bot drew this piece of art

Glory to will
%
So I went back to vim
%
I tried several typescript IDEs a while ago, and they were all bad in their own way
%
vs code has really good support for it
%
typescript is really good
%
npm makes up for most of JavaScript's shortcomings
%
I used typescript today.  It was nice

Java may be ugly but the JVM is a true feat of engineering
%
In general, Java tooling is very good
%
I just use Vim though
%
And static analysers
%
Java does have the best IDEs though
%
Doesn't have to be Java
%
I hate it
%
Java is disgusting
%
I'm not compromising here. JVM or bust
%
👏

Go or rust.

%
well, of course
%
very useful reference
%
added a new panel for viewing data
%
that's good

hey i had to touch the dashboard code a while ago, it was actually pretty decent
%
_weakly typed hissing_
%
__hisses__
%
If I have to use the JVM, I use Kotlin
%
🐍
%
_hiss_
%
we use JS here
%
does anybody want to write a discord bot in java w/ me?
%
Why?
%
Uh, no?
%
Restart the bot
%
I'm going to go home now
%
Give us another chance
%
Shush
%
Of what users?  Unless I've missed something, you didn't escape Docker
%
Ive been yaj hacked
%
ALSO READ OUT USER INFO
%
It's just a list of users
%
Is that useful?
%
And what was that?
%
We read out the content of /etc/passwd
%
I'll see about getting a better sandbox
%
As long as only the container is compromised
%
Ok
%
Uh
%
Scroll up Eric 😛

How’d that happen?

it redirects to some malicious search engine

KHAI'S BOT IS DOING SOMETHING

WHOA
%
Make it beat Ethan
%
Using the javascript libraries, the bot itself is Dogespork and does nothing
%
But your ships weren’t doing anything, which isn’t what the starter bots do
%
Yeah
%
dogespork is a transpiled language
%
But your language is “Dogespork”
%
no?  Just using the javascript one

at least his pathfinding is better than yours

shouldn't be tooo difficult

Can I bring 2 calculators to the test and a transfer cable?
%
no way to program new ones
%
when you press it, it says they are disabled
%
```
Press the PRGM key, which should display a
“Programs have been disabled” message.```
%
it seems to indicate it
%
no
%
can you write more programs during the test?
%
then it will not delete them
%
if the OS is updated
%
I guess
%
```This feature will delete all RAM and Archive except for the disabled Apps and Programs when using operating system 2.40 or greater.
```
%
```
Press the PRGM key, which should display a
“Programs have been disabled” message.```
%
but displays a reset screen
%
it appears to disable them
%
actually it looks like the test mode deletes them instead of just disabling them
%
why would they disable programs?
%
It is terrible in several ways

yeah, it requires connecting the calculator to another computer or calculator
%
yes
%
They have a test mode?
%
yeah
%
Aren't you guys using TI-84s?
%
You could also back up your storage onto your computer
%
<@!144564006710018049> I don't think so, though there is a test mode you can put it in if you are worried about score-cancelation.

else nobody would win

1. If it sees a winning move, it takes it.
2. If it sees a winning move for the opponent, it blocks that move
3. Otherwise, random AI ftw
%
so it just places it moves randomly until it sees a winning move?
%
so it's a bot?

Hmm

%
It just ignored your messages
%

%
No it didn't

%
And I didn't write it...
%
It never did?
%

Clean.
%
That would be bad.
%
No.
%
Btw, where it says 'Guzaboo's turn' at the bottom of the embed, change that to user.displayName so it says Quiet One's turn.
%
No, it only allows 2 player games against yourself
%
Stop that
%
Hey

That I had to change
%
In the end, there was an option for it in KDE's graphical settings
%
I've never seen it used outside of startx
%
That's a file I changed, but adds overrode it
%
xinitrc? Or something else?
%
apparently sddm overrides all of that and does its own thing

I kept changing my xconfig files, but it had no effect, and I was really confused

%
the database of fortunes I'm using appears to be dated October 26, 1998
%
or is just a bunch of really old jokes quotes etc
%
does the database ever get updated
%
fortune is like 30 years old
%
`^^^^^^`
%
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
%
my new question: who is exactly determining what goes on this database
%
okay coolio
%
```js
 exec('fortune -s', (err, stdout, stderr) => {    // Executes the fortune command
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error encountered: ' + stderr);
    return;
  };
  message.channel.send(stdout, {'code': true});
  message.delete();
});```
%
it captures stdout and returns it as a message
%
```fortune -s```

why would typeof return undefined?  It returns strings

this is someone's fault

The string
%
are you serious

I think you mean "undefined"

how does this make sense

```  if (typeof ipChannel != undefined) console.log('Located IP channel: ' + ipChannel.name);
                                                                                   ^

which you can use for self bots
%
you can see your personal token
%
and then go to the application tab
%
That's a lot of reasons

I don't even know who made the bot
%
No idea
%
where does it source its images?
%
No, there's a lot of them
%
or a random picture?
%
The same picture each time?
%
A picture of a shibe

In another server I'm in, there's a bot that responds to !shibe

<@!194597054675156992> <@!172997390238875648> By the way if you have a ti-84 or 83 calculator in the window options at the very bottom there is something called Xres that is set to 1 by default.  However, if you set it to 2 it will show a spike wherever there is a discontinuity.

And I had a really annoying issue with the swap
%
I mean, it would be difficult to uninstall KDE
%
So it sells your data to Amazon? /s
%
It's like Ubuntu with Pacman
%
Manjaro is pretty great
%
Goodnight
%
Everything seems to work for now
%
Well
%
xd
%
the fact that ranger takes over a minute to download is sort of indicative of my wifi experience today
%
when you update
%
I think the kernel has to be released by Manjaro or something
%
there are a lot of defaults to change/fix after install
%
So the install is a bit more heavyweight
%
Manjaro only comes packaged with a DE
%
yeah
%
Is there a difference after install?
%
I get pacman and KDE without much of a hassle
%
anyhow, Manjaro is great
%
it was interesting
%
and a second "backup bios" started and reinstalled it
%
...
%
I actually somehow managed to corrupt the bios
%
just because I kept having issues with the BIOS not playing nice with my partition tables and grub
%
I reformatted my drive literally 5 times trying to install arch
%
Setting it up is sort of a pain
%
I don't remember GRUB being that bad, but it's been a while 🤷
%
which doesn't really have BIOS support
%
I used bootctl on my other installation
%
Because my computer's BIOS doesn't have UEFI support
%
GRUB?  why are you using GRUB?
%
I'm way too lazy to be bothered with this grub stuff
%
Manjaro is the best
%
thnx
%
im proud of u
%
good job will

yay I won!

😠
%
The question is silly
%
therefore it is meaningless
%
it has less upvotes
%
I meant the second answer there
%
in the first link you sent
%
<:angery:345679082496851968>
%
I'm using the same function as is in the top stack overflow answer
%
yes
%
Me?
%
Anything but what you're doing right now
%
Or you could just use setTimeout
%
why in the heck would I want more dependencies eric
%
https://www.npmjs.com/package/timeout-as-promise
%
await setTimeout?
%
The point is don't
%
eric
%
that's the function I'm using
%
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await
%
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6921895/synchronous-delay-in-code-execution
%
I have to redo a lot of the code
%
```js
if (masterState.prototype.has(message.author.id) {
// Check what game they're in
// Then do the game things
}```
%
that's what I'm doing
%
yeah
%
just map it by the player's ID and don't let them play more than one game at a time?
%
THE DELAY FUNCTION IS PERFECT
%
NO
%
players currently ingame
%
Pretty sure that's the first candidate for replacing for performance
%
y'know
%
`active players` lol
%
all my bots have that function cuz I use it for everything
%
which is more useful for a database of active players
%
Is this the bot with the weird delay function?
%
maps let me track keys
%
fine, follow your \❤
%
why did you mention eric in that?
%
and I kind of like the idea of performance
%
<@!187350722965274625> I've never constructed maps before, I've never had any reason to since I use arrays just fine xd
%
and that spikes somewhat when you spam
%
running 6 bots uses like 6% of the cpu just idle
%
node.js is pretty inefficient
%
I mean
%
it's not like you have to worry about processing time
%
and the goal isn't to scrape by with the easiest thing
%
Why are maps difficult?
%
so are maps?
%
arrays are ez
%
eric stop the sorcery talk
%
don't listen to eric
%
What about a database?
%
why?
%
do it with an array
%
lol that's what I'm doing except with a map
%
just have an array of games lol
%
for an object to track multiple games
%
I'm working on understanding + implementing maps
%
I really like Promises the way they were
%
it will consume you
%
it's dark magic
%
It feels wrong
%
await is your friend
%
yeah that thing is witchcraft

I've somewhat fixed it by calling the function as discarding the result before calling it
%
But my randInt() function appears to always return a 2 the first time it's called
%
I'm trying to randomly select either 1 or 2
%
<@!187350722965274625> I have an issue
%
Otherwise it will fail to compile properly, and will attempt to download clang
%
If you use Arch, add "--system-libclang" to the arguments for YCM
%

%
Done
%
And I'm adding the colorscheme as a plug in a second
%
there is one change needed
%
If you're on arch
%
You need the bleeding edge
%
You need to try vim-plug
%
Eric
%
Indeed.
%
Yes?
%
SHIFTWIDTH
%
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
%
I understand what ts is.
%
What is sw…?
%
yep
%
et is probably short for expandtab, which I think would be responsible for the spaces
%
```set sw=4 ts=4 et```
%
?
%
noexpandtab?
%
But now when I press tab, it prints out spaces
%
I fixed it
%
Well
%
this indentation is insane
%
I have 1 minor problem to fix
%
And I changed the colorscheme
%
I had to add an argument to one of the plugins in compilation
%
I have a nearly identical "experience" between my machines
%
Also because I'm lazy and don't care
%
I have minimal configuration to ensure a similar experience between the several machines I work with
%
And it is transparent in the second screenshot too
%
My terminal is transparent
%
That's neat
%
my screenshot tool saved my terminal output instead of the picture
%
What the heck
%

%
It is the most glorious vim configuration to exist
%
<@!187350722965274625> worship my vim config
%
You need to try vim-plug
%
liar
%
I didn't know you didn't know?
%
<@!187350722965274625> why didn't you tell me vim did all these things?
%
now my computer has an email address
%
I setup the public IP mailer
%
It's more like a package manager, and it gives you control over whether packages are active on certain document types and stuff
%
You should try vim-plug, as opposed to pathogen.
%
`execute pathogen#infect()
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on`
%
🤔
%
excited?
%
School starts in less than an hour
%
<@!187350722965274625> What is your vim config like?

...why do you have SSH in screen in the first place?
%
Hmm
%
I am, but I'm not intending to

I think I'm somehow nesting ssh sessions inside screen?

🤔
%
?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?
%
That depends on what server you're referring to
%
your fault collin
%
I FORGOT TO SSH
%
OH

I don't have anything to do with the status of your bot

Why did the server die?

Unfortunately, attempts the put the whole thing in the URL didn't work

Why is arco offline?

Everything, collin.

And my paragraph connects within the scope of the story to the paragraph beneath it.

I thought there was no point to the story other than general creativity.
%
The point of this kind of story is to make it unrelated so that it is hard to connect to.

<@!245387425164034049> I think you should rewrite your paragraph.

You should write your paragraph

you should make your bot go on a spastic rage every time someone puts asterisks around the word 'will'

too, remove duplicate letters = to
%
what was?

unless that was supposed to be a pun

harro

bro
%
that is cheap af
%
lolol
%
nah I was going to say keep a hidden text channel with a config message that contains the letter о, and when your bot starts find that message and save that character in a string.
%
I'm de-blacklisting the word bro for now
%
so I'm trying to think of other ways
%
de-blacklist the word bro?
%
but it would be a really poor solution
%
I know of a solution
%
lol
%
But javascript appears to convert о's in the code to standard o's
%
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

I CAN'TZ

just replace all о's with o's

The webpage at {link} might be temporarily down...

If you copy the link off the error page it works

%
Chrome flagged the very long link as "UNSAFE_REDIRECT"
%
look at this master work of html: ```html
<html><head><title>Lonk</title></head><body><a href="">Click here to continue</a></body></html>```
%
which is a page with a link to itself
%
...maybe?
%
If you just push lonkify on the lonk.pw page, it generates a link

What counts as an informal term? "Hey" would be informal

and for the purposes of not swearing, informal terms are considered swearing.

I mean, who wouldn't want to be apart of a costly cult? It's my life dream!
%
```
"I was NOT going to be part of something like this. I threw out the invitation to apply. Shortly after, they emailed me. Great. They were one of those organizations. I ignored everything they sent me. I then didn't hear from them for a while-- that is, until the cult leader herself emailed me telling me it was now or never to apply. I had had enough, and I made that very clear."```
%
Give it time, eventually they will raid yelp to give them good reviews
%
Me too Celina
%

%
And give up your firstborn child
%
Then you need to view some surveys
%
you need to pay a $55 report access fee
%
How do I report them on google?
%
It is a for profit organization feeding off of parents who want success for their child. What do you expect?

%
All the 5 star accounts have 1 review and 6 contributions
%

%
The "NATIONAL SOCIETY OF HIGH SCHOLARS" are creating alternate accounts and upvoting their own answers on the google review page
%
Yes but it works because "look I'm apart of something"
%
It's totally meaningless, and it costs a ton
%
Yeah it's basically a scam
%
Everyone Ive talked to was invited. I didn't bother, i don't have no money to give them
%
Especially considering they invited Will...
%
Yeah
%
They must really want their money
%
Yup
%
I bet you got an identical email
%
<@!194597054675156992> lol the "NATIONAL SOCIETY OF HIGH SCHOLARS" extended their deadline just for me!

Are the bulk delete targets still called 'Victims'?
%
expansion is easier
%
xD
%

%
it's so clean now
%
Yeah
%
I was able to replace so many for loops
%
things like .splice() and .slice() are so handy
%
and cleaned out most of the code
%
But I fixed Arco's problems
%
sorry
%
k
%
my bad
%
Accidentally deleted a hundred messages
%
OOPS
%
Are you sure it's the right message?
%
why in the hecking heck is users empty?
%
wot
%
```js
users: Collection {}```
%
oh nvm
%
why in the hecking heck is it a ReactionEmoji
%
why do I even have perl packages?
%
Ugh, all my perl packages are broken
%
oh
%
why in the hecking heck does it not have a users variable
%
```js
_emoji: ReactionEmoji { reaction: [Circular], name: '�', id: null }```
%
oh yeah
%
ok
%
I don't think string concatenation works well for that
%
```js
Found the ok reaction
0|ajax     | okReaction:
0|ajax     | [object Object]
0|ajax     | 0 users reacted with the ok reaction
0|ajax     | users:```
%
```js
const okReaction = welcome.reactions.find(r => r.emoji.name === '🆗');
        console.log('Found the ok reaction');
        console.log('okReaction:\n'+okReaction);
        var users = okReaction.users.array();
        console.log(users.length+' users reacted with the ok reaction')
        console.log('users:\n'+users);
        for(var i=0; i<users.length; i++){
          var index = findRole(member.roles.array(), 'New');
          if(index != -1){
            var member = idToGuildMember(users[i].id);
            index = findRole(member.guild.roles.array(), 'Observers');
            if(index != -1){
              member.addRole(member.guild.roles.array()[index]);
            }
            index = findRole(member.roles.array(), 'New');
            if(index != -1){
              member.removeRole(member.guild.roles.array()[index]);
            }

The best way to get a response here is to say this place is dead.

Why does it have so many dependencies?

What does it do?

The Reddit bot?  It's a Reddit bot

<@!187350722965274625> Is this a reddit bot?

Whoa

IT WILL BE DELETED UNLESS I AM APPEASED
%
kk cool
%
or at least I haven't been told of any plans to delete it
%
no one was going to delete it
%
what?
%
keep the server, I will be more active
%

%
This server should liiive
%
I changed my mind
%
tyler's server
%
What counts as dead?
%
Dead
%
yes
%
The one who keeps saying "dead". Khai right?
%
Who are you talking to?
%
You keep saying this place is dead. Do you want it to be? It seems that way.

your vote could not be accepted

I changed 1 number

As long as the local changes weren't important

erase everything and pull again
%
only 1 way forward
%
"error: Merging is not possible because you have unmerged files."
%
thnx github
%
Or that
%
You can manually fix up the files, or use a merge tool
%
--force is more fun
%
how
%
I guess you should resolve them?
%
yes I do
%
yes
%
Do you have unpushed commits?  That looks like a merge conflict

and github merged the error message with my code?
%
I git pulled it
%
what the heck
%
?
%
wth
%
what
%
maybe I should make it trigger more
%
I do not like it
%
the random number generator in js is awful
%
aren't you <@!290543075233628160>?
%
slave_1 is perfect tho
%
But the username stuff might require doing it this way
%
There's a difference between waiting and hanging
%
and it needs to send the message with its new nickname
%
discord lags and doesn't change the nickname for a variable amount of time
%
it is
%
Hanging the script doesn't sound like a good idea
%
I don't trust that witchcraft
%
what?
%
Why is there a delay function instead of setTimeout?
%
no
%
it does everything you need
%
it's the best

colin, what is exparvis?
%
Or what's left of him
%
I am Owen Smith
%
I only had 7th cohort with you
%
because of minion clicker?

Ya that's probably why I don't know you

this is sad, is what it is
%
http://colin.reederhome.net/minionclicker.html

what is this

colin
%
maybe, maybe not

Is that who you are?

Huh, forgot about that thing
%
Colin Reeder?
%
http://colin.reederhome.net/
%
So I'm clueless
%
You probably know Khai then from the morning Computer Science class
%
I love that bot
%
*username
%
you could literally google his name
%
It's pronounced Maciganoosh
%
You would be wrong
%
I think you are Aidan Mcintyre
%
If he's friends with Khai, he probably was this year.
%
At one point, yes.
%
Are you were in 10th cohort?
%
?
%
were*
%
Are you in 10th cohort?
%
I don't even know what's happening anymore
%
hmm... 🤔
%
I can see Guzaboo is friends with him
%
ask him
%
I think he's in like 6th
%
here's a documentary on him: https://youtu.be/KEkrWRHCDQU
%
What cohort is he in?
%
I do both morning and afternoon, and I have never heard of anyone named "eric"
%
he commutes
%
also he goes to tvmsc
%
Rocket League*
%
btw I moved to Alaska
%
No I found him in Alaska
%
Did you find him on rocket league?
%
he lives in Alaska
%
I know of no "eric"
%
si
%
eric?
%
eric obv
%
I am
%
So who is <@!187350722965274625>?
%
thanks <@!290543075233628160>

what is exparvis?

I have no idea what that means

This is very odd

%
<@!192460058515341312> tsk tsk
%
but for obvious reasons, I need to turn it off sometimes
%
The effects do look nice, so I don't want to disable the compositor
%
why would you want to do that /s
%
as well as a shortcut to disable the compositor
%
and it works really well
%
I added my i3 keybindings
%
Yeah
%
As long as you don't screw up your install it's actually pretty decent

I used it for a while some time ago

<@!189855390295523328> What is your opinion on KDE Plasma?

%
I figured out how to compile with allegro at least
%
learn c++ and help me make WEXAS
%
omg
%
But it will be in Java
%
Haven't made it yet
%
unless the game is rigged or something, which I bet it is
%
And my bot will destroy yours
%
Send it to me l8er
%
I will cry
%
If you say Java
%
What language?
%
Make an ai better than mine
%
No it is a simple game
%
<@!194597054675156992> is this game going to be like WEXAS?
%
I'm going to program a game an you're going to make an ai for it
%
Will
%
Tomorrow, I'm going to try to convert to KDE
%
I'll work on it at some point
%
I need to make a slander command.
%
that hurt
%
wow
%
actually yeah
%
nah
%
voice chat?
%
probably
%
it's now learning human behavior such as sarcasm
%
out of a switch case statement
%
im such a good programmer i prolly made a neural net on accident
%
maybe it was being sarcastic
%
it said that "the computer is 32-bit" was your opinion
%
yeah
%
obviously wasn't up long enough for you to see
%
It said opinion

the messages are shown for long enough to be visible

yyyy
%
SLAVE_1 does
%
I don't
%
lol why do you have <@!290543075233628160> running if you just keep deleting the messages?
%
I love SLAVE_1's messages just popping in every so often
%
google a gameplay video then
%
idk how that means pseudo-turn-based
%
It's typically pretty slow
%
it doesn't matter much though
%
I believe it is
%
probably not pausable in multiplayer though
%
you open doors, and a bunch of monsters spawn, and you manage your heroes between rooms
%
what do you mean by pseudo-turn-based?
%
but pseudo-turn-based
%
pausable as well
%
it's a pseudo-turn-based strategy game with tower defense elements
%
🤦
%
What you mean "dungeon games"?
%
huh?
%
I don't really play dungeon games
%
maybe
%
eh
%
and it's really good
%
It goes down to $3 in past sales
%
You should get Dungeon of Endless if you can
%
I admit
%
mine is shameful in comparison
%
your wishlist is pretty good
%
fine
%
sort it
%
What matters more is what is on it
%
sort it
%
My list isn't sorted very well
%
correct
%
Rocket League is only number 23 on your list.
%
y not
%
no
%
<@!194597054675156992> invite me to your server please
%
k
%
it drives yours to cower in fear
%
You must observe the glory of my wishlist
%
then I have suggestions!
%
probably
%
Are you getting anything over the summer sale?
%
no
%
o wow look No Man's Sky is up to 37% positive reviews
%
<@!194597054675156992> Do you have a finalized wishlist?

2 much windows 4 windows
%
still won't let me send it

I didn't block you at least
%
lol

%
<:windowsdefender:323308953188565002>

pacaur just does it m8

it constantly prompts for stupid things

yaourt is trash

(:
%
now I use pacaur

imma wring your neck if you don't install yaourt
%
yaourt scum

LOL
%
What?
%
yaourt >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> pacaur
%
gross GROSS PACAUR
%
it turns out there were no tokens and everything is fixed and perfect now
%
Awhile ago I told you my github was broken and full of tokens
%
okay nvm
%
what
%
if someone else got them, they could use them to login to the bot's accounts
%
like the things my bots use to connect with discord
%
ummm what are tokens
%
<@!282599419784855552> It turns out there aren't any tokens lurking in my github 😃
%
I'm trying to learn a new trick on my yoyo, but the strings keep locking up the bearing and it's driving me crazy.
%
But the random number generator in javascript is very weighted from what I've seen
%
it has a supposedly 1 in 8 chance of triggering
%
*Will* it work?
%
Fuse extended
%
I'm gonna extend SLAVE_1's fuse
%
It's the summer
%
11:11 isn't late
%
It's only 11:11.

someone's up late
%
Nothing quite as satisying as pacaur -Syu
%
SLAVE_1 fills 2.9 megabytes
%
Arco fills 15.2 megabytes
%
Optimized Arco's disk impact
%
that's probably for the best
%
I don't believe you
%
fixed it now
%
xd
%
but i just did message.delete()
%
it was supposed to delete its own message
%
xd it did delete your message khai
%
I am very stupid
%
OOPS
%
Oh so sybaritic is Khai. Good to know.
%
Changes are implementing
%
rip Khai's spam 😄
%
because I am way more superior than Will
%
10/10
%
Minute Arco will make this go away
%
STOP I NEED TO CHECK THE LOGS
%
That can't have happened
%
What?
%
HE DELETED MY MESSAGE
%
Soon, Arco will be more powerful than ever
%
I need to add a trigger to Arco

mfw intellij can't auto-generate javadoc comments using heuristic analysis
%

%

mfw intellij can automatically pull members up

I cannot type today.

intellij
%
What application do you have called "Programming" in Steam?
%
blis hlep
%
good 4 you
%
and i have to write documentation for each one
%
4 down, a ton to go
%

%
ugggggg javadocs
%
interfacing is breaking my shit
%
java is so disgusting
%
Hate what?
%
i hate this
%

%
oops
%
would that work
%
pointers are sorcery
%
if(system 'clear') {system(echo "Error your version of Windows is incomplete, please downgrade to Windows 8 & try again")}
%
write to protected memory
%
if(platform == windows) { //crash os }
%
I don't think I need vulkan
%
the graphics are colored blocks
%
I don't want those filthy windows users benefiting from my work
%
:DDDDDDDDDDDD
%
if you're feeling gooey and don't mind no documentation or tutorials use vulkan
%
ew cross platform
%
maybe sdl
%
take your pick
%
sfml or opengl
%
Specifically it's a game
%
But I need a gui
%
I'm trying to make a c++ application
%
let me hear it
%
ok
%
I have a maybe stupid question
%
but its harddddd to rewrite the public classes to interfacify themselves
%
i don't even want circular dependencies, the api should be its own thing
%
there must be exploitz
%
it tries, but circular dependencies cause infinite loops, which it detects, aborting
%
it won't even try? 😦
%
it won't build
%
so can you still push it the the server or whatever with circular dependencies?
%
yep
%
makes it harder to break the things
%
for me
%
which is sad
%
good design
%
smart actually
%
sad
%
it builds the modules seperately so it doesn't mix sources
%
define "doesn't allow"
%
that's sad
%
gradle doesn't allow circular dependencies
%
no
%
do I drop in there?
%
STOP AND ROLL
%
cicular dependencies are good tho
%
and since circular dependencies are bad™ i have to make everything that i want to be accessable to the jr devs part of the api
%
i split my plugin into two gradle modules, api and main
%
reee separating interface from implementation is harder than i thought

"cancerous console peasants"?
%
open the gates!
%
no
%
but we need them
%
I mean hey, at least we don't get cancerous console peaseants and illiterate 4 year olds on the PC servers.
%
I thought they would've tried sooner.
%
But they will probably try.
%
can't force me
%
Microsoft is slowly gonna force us to the Windows 10 edition
%
Before there was the "Java Edition", and the copycat lesser versions. Now there's 2 competing versions.
%
but it's dividing minecraft into 2 editions
%
I love how it says it's unifying minecraft
%
/s
%
microsoft always makes things better
%
hah
%
>inb4 not a single notch line of code is left

MINECRAFT NEEDS 4K GRAPHICS
%
yeah lol
%
and perhaps a few others
%

xd
%
MW10, MSE, MPE, MX1E, MPS4E
%
So have fun with your minecraft loaded with microtransactions 😄
%
Which is amusing
%
Indeed.
%
From the article
%
Yeah
%
All other versions of Minecraft will henceforth be known as "Minecraft"
%
Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition is also affected 😄
%
Funnily enough, as you sent me that i am writing a bukkit plugin
%
Minecraft: Java Edition master race
%
Indeed.

I got a new graphics card, it's not much but is better than the old garbage I had.
%
Too*
%
Excuses excuses.
%
we don't need all these fancy gigabytes of things
%
256K ram is where computer science should've stopped ok
%
but its a bit bugged
%
then its supposed to resume
%
and when 10000 milliseconds have passed
%
it repeatedly gets the milliseconds passed since midnight
%
and my delay function is kind of a hack
%
node is bugging out to
%
well
%
But not bots? Sad.
%
and windows xp
%
it can run minecraft
%
hey
%
Will you're so old
%
either way, it can't handle the bots
%
wow
%
intel atom
%
2009 MiB RAM top of the line
%
it's not exactly the best
%
thats the computer's specs soooo

and the computer hosting the bots is bugging out

it just waits 10000 milliseconds before it deletes the message

no

so it's every other message now?

I love roblox SOOO much, I love how you can play games made by others, i love how you can get free stuff from events to make your character cool EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE ROBUX like me! but there is a few problems... its rlly hard to play roblox on mobile which is why I got a PC. ALMOST EVERY ONE HAS ROBUX and make me feel left out. and there are so many scammers and bots making making "free robux scams" and spamming groups with links to them. and i rlly hate how people keep dressing up as "noobs" >:/ . but all in all roblox is still REALLY fun to play nd all the bad stuff IS ignorable but i do wish it culd be removed easier. thx for such and amaizing game. Few things i wish were added: I rlly wish people who have played for a long time receive robux. i wish tix were back cause that would go with wish 1. I wish dating in roblox is allowed cause people dont actually date in roblox unless their role playing wich means its just in game so i wont get yelled at any more in role play games.
ANOTHER STORY OF ME GETTING GAME:

Me: Now what do you want?

IN STEAM CHAT:

Me: Hello? "Friend"? Are you there?

OUTSIDE:

Friend: LET'S SEE HOW WELL YOU FLY, PIG!

FRIEND ENTERS STEAM CHAT

Me: So Mr.Goat, what would you say if my friend entered the Steam chat right here?
Me: Oh...he showed up...Hoi, friend...
Friend: I WILL FIND YOU GOAT

FRIEND LEAVES THE CHAT

Me: Yeah, you're dead, goat.
Me: I'm gonna actually play the game I just got...

I PLAY MINECRAFT STORY MODE...

Me: ...I'm treating Lukas like poop and he still hangs with me as if nothing happened! Do the choices really matter here? Sure, the huge choices obviously matter, but I feel like I'm not actually impacting the game in any significant way! So much for "The game is tailored by how you play". But oh well, this game has it's charm, so that's why I still like it.

Also make it remove the symbols before correcting
%
Like an 'ignore' list
%
Also, you should have a list of words it doesn't correct, but also doesn't use as suggestions
%
Will you should make it so we can do %suggest <word> and Arco will save the word in a text file for you to decide whether or not to add it to the dictionary
%
Arco, stop your flailing about.

<@!245387425164034049> And if a hold command while it's typing, it does this

Yes yes I was that is a thing I can do
%
?
%
You were just copying and pasting windows
%
And if a hold command while it's typing, it does this
%
I broke it a bit
%
Actually, I was rerunning the script I made to play Khai's game
%
To make himself feel superior, Phillip Q. January III copied and pasted windows and then spent an hour organizing them to make it look like there was a error.  Sad man
%
Can Windows do this?
%
nope
%
^^Khai
%

%
Java is trash
%
Let me guess, Khai wants to only use Java becuase it was used to program Minecraft.  What a loser

yes.

%
<@267529289220489217> ey you got a Github account
%
which is coincidentally the ASCII code for 'W'
%
and 57h is an 8-bit number
%
because RAX is a 64-bit register
%
and then a bunch of zeroes
%
It just loads the memory address 0x57 to RAX
%
I don't think it would actually do anything practical.
%
```asm

%
u can't do it here
%
but I don't know how to make it do something as advanced as generals.io
%
and it works
%
I studied a program that learns how to print "Hello, world!"
%
I read the basics of it
%
let me look into this
%
I want to too
%
a learning AI is very hard to program
%
literally 3 seperate arrays of about 480 numbers each
%
I want to set up a learning ai but I don't know how
%
it spams the console with the huge arrays it has to use
%
even that is *@#**@!#* hell
%
and i want to log the map
%
omfg
%
just installed windows 10 creators update
%
maybe check every tile at the start of the game until you find it? xd
%
the  example bot is so stupid
%
I have no idea
%
ikr
%
but I don't know if it works
%
how do i even get my queen's location?
%
I made a function to turn it into a 2d array
%
ikr
%
but noooooo
%
i've outlined how I want to interact with it
%
they could've just used a 2d array
%
it's a piece of crap
%
I KNOW
%
But this array that comes back with all the data is so unwieldy
%
I've logically lined up the first things I want it to do
%
rrrr
%
KHAI!
%
ikr
%
I have no idea how to start.
%
ALGORITHMS == HACKS!
%
ALGORITHMS!
%
!!!!
%
I'm working on a pathfinding algorithm rn
%
my bot will wreck urs once i start making it
%
too bad u should
%
but idc rn
%
except the space
%
it does match
%
so that it matches
%
no but change the custom_game_id
%
noob
%
I already have that
%
no
%
add ```js
var custom_game_id = 'The Bowl';

socket.emit('join_private', custom_game_id, user_id);
socket.emit('set_force_start', custom_game_id, true);``` to your code.
%
lol
%
<@!194597054675156992> The%20Bowl is the custom game_id
%
it is just a lone 'A'
%
it literally has no I
%
😄
%
it makes random numbers and moves in random directions
%
it's programming is trash
%

%
I will check when I am able
%
<@!194597054675156992> I sent you the code
%
is syncordPlayers undefined or is an element *in* syncordPlayers undefined?
%
When the bot is initialized
%
It does var syncordPlayers = []
%
What do you mean?
%
with one element
%
define it then
%
The bug isn't the message author, it's that the array syncordPlayers is supposedly undefined
%

<@!194597054675156992> is a god tier rubber duck
%
And it doesn't seem to stay declareed
%
ya stupe
%
I declare the other string
%
not that
%
nvm
%
wait
%
The username of a message author should never be null
%
😃
%
I read the manual.
%
so do null checks and RTFM
%
message.author.username is part of the discord api
%
so dont make it a null pointer
%
it shouldn't be undefined
%
so define it
%
yeah

%
Like how u make em

%
Actually...
%
Wait I lied I need 7
%
That shouldn't take long tho, I just need 3 diamonds and after I'm done with this I should get those 3
%
The first thing I should do tho is get an auto sieve for diamonds...
%
However if you know of another way to build an auto tree farm I'm down
%
But also I could build a vanilla afk tree farm but that doesn't really interest me as much
%
And I figured open computers might have something so yeah :P
%
So what I was going to do was use a turtle for an auto tree farm but they no longer have turtles in sf3
%
Is it possible to have a computer do an auto tree farm?
%
ill be done in an hour

i gotta go work for my mom

Extra kinky

Origins[edit]
Medieval Britain during the time the Plantagenet kings ruled England during (1154–1485).

Appearance[edit]
The rack is a torture device that consists of an oblong, rectangular, usually wooden frame, slightly raised from the ground, with a roller at one, or both, ends, having at one end a fixed bar to which the legs were fastened, and at the other a movable bar to which the hands were tied. The victim's feet are fastened to one roller, and the wrists are chained to the other.

Use[edit]
The torturer turned the handle causing the ropes to pull the victim's arms. Eventually, the victim's bones were dislocated with a loud crack, caused by snapping cartilage, ligaments or bones. If the torturer kept turning the handles the limbs would eventually be torn off.

This method was mostly used to extract confessions, not confessing meant that the torturer could stretch more. Sometimes, torturers forced their victim to watch other people be tortured with this device to implant psychological fear.

Many knights from the Knights Templar were tortured with the rack. The limbs collected from this and other punishments of the time were "emptied by the hundreds".

Sometime this method was limited to dislocating a few bones, but the torturer often went too far and rendered the legs or arms (sometimes both) useless. In the late Middle Ages, some new variants of this instrument appeared. They often had spikes that penetrated the victim's back - as the limbs were pulled apart, so was his or her spinal cord increasing not only in physical pain, but the psychological one of being handicapped at best, too.

Kinky
%
The Rack
%
What if a fat guy got in there
%
Someone ban owen
%
It's like in despicable me
%
This torture device consisted of an iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior, sufficient enough to enclose a human being. Once inside its conical frame, the victim would be unable to move due to the great number of steel spikes impaling them from every direction. The interrogator would scream questions at the victim while poking them with jagged edges.

it's not hard
%
learn assembly khai
%
C# is literally java trash
%
C# is much more protected and gives you compiler errors and warnings without allowing you to make some serious errors that C++ will allow
%
C# programs are usually targeted towards the Windows operating system, although Microsoft is working towards cross-platform support for C# programs. With C++, you can code for any platform including Mac, Windows and Linux
%
C# binaries are much larger after it compiles compared to C++
%
C++ code is much faster than C# code
%
I'm going to make a game with c++
%
that's why it's trash
%
ik
%
>:)
%
C# doesn't work on Mac :)
%
LITERALLY JAVA

Don't make me use C#

I took it and got INT-J-A

Really quite a shame.
%
Did you know INT-P's are the reason acronyms exist, because they can't maintain focus on one thing long enough to type out multiple words? True fact.
%
Indeed.

Wth
%
No, still does.
%
Literally it was his dream job.
%
Aspired*
%
My best friend in elementary school aspires to be a plumber
%
Sadly I used to be a plumber
%
And you being an INT-P, you just don't understand these things.
%
If you read something that says otherwise, it was probably being sarcastic.
%
--Leading Scientists
%
"The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there’s nothing they're good at. INTPs pride themselves on their nonexistent inventiveness and creativity, their generic perspective and hilariously simplistic and vegetable-like intellect. Usually known as the plumber, the fool, or the dreamy farmer, INTPs have been responsible for the destruction of many scientific discoveries throughout history."
%
That's something an inferior INTJ would do
%
No

You misspelled something didn't you?

I might expand my text adventure over the summer
%
lots of deadlines for this
%
I won't start until march though
%
thnx

%
I kinda guessed
%
actually I was going to make your textadventure into an OS after I finish this
%
👏
%
best OS 2017
%
👍
%
while demanding you wire money to me to unlock your disk
%
if it can't access your wireless adapter it will throw a fit and start putting random 0's in all disks connected to your computer
%
👍
%
you won't have control over your desktop
%
Do it
%
I will add ads before I add a text editor
%
xd xd
%
And sell adspace for WillOS Home

Make WillOS Home and WillOS Professional

then I will write a file to do that

Which both khai and I have done
%
Every good operating system has credits
%
You can disable it under settings
%
):
%
no
%
does tts work?
%
For fixing your bug
%
what credits?
%
what profits?
%
what for?
%
?
%
I require that you put my name in the credits and give me 5% of all profits
%
mmm hmm
%
Btw
%
Eww no
%
macOS master race
%
👏
%
making it into a .command file because screw linux users
%
Nice
%
bam made my first ever shell script to assemble the source
%
khai this is insane
%
<:hipig:280019932937453569>
%

%
which meant the original floppy had like, 300 unneeded bytes of 0's
%
and did errors if the kernel was larger
%
Like it padded the kernel out to 512 bytes
%
It just has some quirks
%
No.
%
Optimizing... so you can run it on your peasant Macintosh hardware
%
Removed unnecessary padding in kernel
%
now for optimization
%
the bootloader is just a test
%
I'm gonna make it better now
%
WILL @#*!@#* OS
%

%
YES
%
I HAVE WILLOS
%
I CAN HAVE INFINITE SPACE
%
I CAN HAVE FILES
%
THE BOOTLOADER TRANSFERS CONTROL TO THE KERNEL
%
What
%
IT #*!@(!@ WORKS
%
YES YES YES
%
YES
%
jk nope
%
maybe we can make it fill 512 bytes
%
uh uh
%
it fills 82 kilobytes
%
>:[
%
nvm im extracting it myself

it's highly inefficient

y
%
<@!194597054675156992> Can you send me your textadventure's source code?
%
"I'd rather sleep in a cage filled with black widows?"
%
It is, but when you buy the cheapest mac available 1.25 years ago, what do you expect?
%
that's basically the message he sent so it's kinda ironic
%
No, but my mac is.
%
lol macs are inferior
%
It spikes my CPU when I select it.

ur not a chemistry necromancer
%
good
%
AP Physics
%
yes.
%
This year?
%
besides comp sci
%
Your legs are like threads of cotton, though much thicker, and filled with weevils.
%
.compliment
%
khai?
%
what is your science course?
%
…
%
a lamentably reprehensible swine and a feculent, heart-sickening molester of small old men.
%
.insult
%
Imbecile
%
vegan
%
Pleb
%
polygamist
%
Trash
%
plus, it's better to have **better** courses when you apply to college anyways
%
maybe
%
probably not
%
Lol are you trying to go to a liberal arts college?
%
IB courses are much better at English, history, and other things
%
Also they don't
%
That way I can take Calculus next year and jump ahead
%
I want to take stats, AP physics and maybe forensics or pre-engineering
%
Then why not take both?
%
I'm pretty sure colleges prefer tvmsc
%
If I get all B+'s or above, I get a sizable scholarship
%
You're trash
%
IB Merit Scholarship
%
Go to TVMSC and whatever high school
%
No
%
Leave your trash private school
%
Either way, I've aced almost every test and the math teacher seems to think I'm a god
%
It would be called AB/BC
%
Like is is at TVMSC
%
Nah
%
I presume it's included in BC
%
Ew
%
Wth
%
The math teacher recommends which course you should take
%
How are you skipping AB?
%
And 3 AP Calculus BC
%
2 AP Calculus AB
%
?
%
1 avg and 1 smrt
%
1 Stupid people math
%
My school offers 3 math courses for next year
%
So
%
That's how BEN is in calculus rn
%
Since always
%
…
%
Since when did they have summer school
%
That was just me saying that
%
That wasn't an answer
%
?
%
I'm gonna see if I can take some TVMSC courses over the summer
%
How are you skipping Calculus AB??
%
It's all stuff I learned
%
Supposedly "Precalc"
%
What about this year?
%
In all probability
%
Apparently I'm just taking Calculus BC
%
Calculus AB/BC
%
Hey, what math course are you taking next year?
%
I actively do
%
I did
%
Will, edit your colleges

/tts CHAPTER 1: Portal

Location: Normal World

Bob was casually walking home at 10:00 at night. He is 25 years old and is wearing jeans

with a plaid shirt. As he was midway through a step, a circular yellow swirl appeared in a

flash of purple light. Bob instinctively tried to run, but a strange, yellow sphere of

electricity appeared and began moving inward, toward the portal. Bob was suddenly sucked

in! He felt like he was moving down a slide. The walls were pulsing blue, red, and green when

suddenly the Walls disappeared and were replaced by a view of a waterfall with a building

beside it. Then, he wasn’t sliding and was in an abandoned mine with torches lining the walls

and two tunnels at the other end of the room. Bob heard dripping down one of the two

tunnels. Down the other tunnel the walls were set in soil. He chose the latter since he

figured soil was closer to the surface. After a while, he reached the surface and found

that he was in the woods at night. The sky had five red moons and no stars. Then he

yawned, realized how tired he was, and lay down and went to sleep.

CHAPTER 2: The Roiz

Location: Weeping Woods

His first thought after he woke up was why am I not hungry? Bob was always hungry in the

mornings. Then he remembered what had happened and decided it must have something to

do with wherever he was. Bob chose a random direction and began walking. Slowly, the

woods got thornier and darker. There were black twisted willows instead of the brighter

looking trees that made up the wood earlier. Bob felt scared, but the sun had set and he

was tired. He lay down and was just falling asleep when he heard a rustle of bushes. A

strange black ball with gnashing teeth covering it flew out of the bushes. It was hovering

five feet above the ground. Bob leapt up and rocketed away. He heard the ball giving chase

and looked back.

[**FML**]  Today, I was on Tinder and only one girl matched with me. She gave me a "Super-Like" so I thought she must want to get to know each other and see what happens. Nope. She recognized me as the guy who adopted the stray cat she was taking care of last year, and just wanted to know how he was doing. FML  :face_palm:

I just hope Schreiber doesn't encounter that bug
%
I LOST 1002 APPLES
%
No
%
FIX THE STUPID BUG
%
Just try again
%
Oh yeah
%
And it crashed
%
And it was like "oh no a boss"
%
I walked into the wilderness
%
What'd u do
%
How
%
Wut
%
MAKE IT FIXED
%
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at Wilderness.battle(Wilderness.java:66)

%
it crashed meh!
%
it was a boss!
%
KAI HALP
%
IT CRASHED
%
4-6?
%
how much damage does a stab do again?
%
or else it tries to repeat eating apple pudding 0 time
%
Apprently I can't input my health as being 30
%
IT WORKS
%
it gave me a "connection is invalid" crash reason
%
a part that was working prior to me making NO OTHER CHANGE than commenting out the dialog
%
a different part of the script bugged out for no apparent reason
%
That's actually really good because 15 is the minimum
%
Good idea
%
and that it will always kill it in 2 hits
%
Ok
%
and just make it assume the monster's health is always 15
%
im gonna remove the prompt
%
let me try something
%
Oh the one on your program
%

3. If you add 300g to the block from question 2, how much does the hanging mass need to have?
%
2. If a 200g block is being pulled by a hanging mass of 300g at a constant velocity, what is the force of kinetic friction?
%
*acting on a cart on a ramp.
%
1. Draw a free body diagram of all the forces acting on a ramp.
%
LOL
%

Now it equips armor after you defeat Barnabus, and I condensed some of the repetive commands near the start
%
I made it even more efficient!
%
xd xd/
%
it would literally completely destroy my script
%
I'm not lol
%
please don't remove the infinite apple generator
%
(that are better than apple)
%
gasp
%
I'm making it so I can add foods
%
but what will i do if it doesn't involve praising the glory of apple?
%
There's worse problems in the latest version
%
>:v
%
Not rn
%
Then send a me a build with those things fixed.
%
Those are already fixed
%
Bug #2: Barnabus doesn't drop his sword
%
Stop it
%
I will soon
%
Bug #1: Health is 30000
%
khai fix all the bugs
%
rrrr
%

%
Java >>>>>>>>>Apple
%
AppleScript >>> JavaScript
%
what?
%
Nurrd
%
I've made it slightly better.
%
<@!194597054675156992> SEND A PATCHED BUILD !!
%
it works
%
there we go
%
It keeps refusing to process the numbers I input in that dialogue
%
It is being a bit rebellious atm
%
oh apparently it's over 2,000 characters
%
I'm making it fight Barnabus
%
here is my script so far
%
grand
%
10 hp
%
<@!194597054675156992> At what level does Barnabus surrender?
%
!!!!
%
I like ricotta cheese
%
what?
%
…
%
yum
%
Also what is this book?
%
Send me the latest textadventure.jar please.
%
I'm reading a book about you
%
yeah i fixed it
%
Ok
%
Well, I am continuing with my macro
%
I fixed that stuff
%
Ik it's bugged
%
also I don't have Barnabus' Sword
%
the game thinks I have 30000 health
%
i found a really weird bug
%
wth
%
how much health does barnabus have?
%
*shakes head in disappointment*
%
AppleScript is the best
%
Right now it's written in the far better language of AppleScript
%
I can't until I get home
%
I will see about converting it into JavaScript
%
I set it up so that it would kill Barnabus
%
Can you send me a fixed build?
%
Also you don't need to go south from the town
%
And equip armor
%
And then eat apples
%
Just make it spam 3 after every movement in the wilderness
%
I can't read the output of the game itself and as a result I can't make it actually do fights

Relationship to heat[edit]
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: dU = δQ − δW. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called pV work, given by p dV (where here p is the pressure at the surface, dV is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work δW′, such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write δW = p dV + δW′. In this case the first law reads:
{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-p\,dV-\delta W',} {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-p\,dV-\delta W',}
or
{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q+V\,dp-\delta W'.} {\displaystyle dH=\delta Q+V\,dp-\delta W'.}
From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added heat:
{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q,} {\displaystyle dH=\delta Q,}
provided that the system is under constant pressure (dp = 0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (δW' = 0).[14]
%
Physical interpretation[edit]
The U term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the pV term as the energy that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, n moles of a gas of volume V at pressure p and temperature T, is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero, energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy U plus pV, where pV is the work done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.
In basic physics and statistical mechanics it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.[11][12] In basic chemistry, experiments are often conducted at constant atmospheric pressure, and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that ΔH is the expression chosen for the heat of reaction.
For a heat engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the pressure-volume work done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:[13]
{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q-\delta W} {\displaystyle dH=\delta Q-\delta W}
where the work W done by the engine is:
{\displaystyle W=-\oint VdP} {\displaystyle W=-\oint VdP}
%
Other expressions[edit]
The above expression of dH in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:[8]:88[10]
{\displaystyle dH=C_{p}\,dT+V(1-\alpha T)\,dp.} {\displaystyle dH=C_{p}\,dT+V(1-\alpha T)\,dp.}
Here Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure and α is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:
{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}.} {\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}.}
With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if Cp and V are known as functions of p and T.
Note that for an ideal gas, αT = 1,[note 2] so that
{\displaystyle dH=C_{p}\,dT.} {\displaystyle dH=C_{p}\,dT.}
In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for dH then becomes
{\displaystyle dH=T\,dS+V\,dp+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}\,dN_{i},} {\displaystyle dH=T\,dS+V\,dp+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}\,dN_{i},}
where μi is the chemical potential per particle for an i-type particle, and Ni is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as μi dni (with dni the number of moles of component i added to the system and, in this case, μi the molar chemical potential) or as μi dmi (with dmi the mass of component i added to the system and, in this case, μi the specific chemical potential).
%
Adding d(pV) to both sides of this expression gives
{\displaystyle dU+d(pV)=T\,dS-p\,dV+d(pV),} {\displaystyle dU+d(pV)=T\,dS-p\,dV+d(pV),}
or
{\displaystyle d(U+pV)=T\,dS+V\,dp.} {\displaystyle d(U+pV)=T\,dS+V\,dp.}
So
{\displaystyle dH(S,p)=T\,dS+V\,dp.} {\displaystyle dH(S,p)=T\,dS+V\,dp.}
%
Formal definition[edit]
The enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as[8][9]
{\displaystyle H=U+pV,} {\displaystyle H=U+pV,}
where
H is the enthalpy of the system,
U is the internal energy of the system,
p is the pressure of the system,
V is the volume of the system.
The enthalpy is an extensive property. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy h = 
H
/
m
, where m is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy Hm = 
H
/
n
, where n is the number of moles (h and Hm are intensive properties). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:
{\displaystyle H=\sum _{k}H_{k},} {\displaystyle H=\sum _{k}H_{k},}
where the label k refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying p, T or composition, the summation becomes an integral:
{\displaystyle H=\int \rho h\,dV,} {\displaystyle H=\int \rho h\,dV,}
where ρ is the density.
The enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function H(S,p) of the entropy S and the pressure p, and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:
{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-\delta W.} {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-\delta W.}
Here, δQ is a small amount of heat added to the system, and δW a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place, so the second law of thermodynamics gives δQ = T dS, with T the absolute temperature of the system. Furthermore, if only pV work is done, δW = p dV. As a result,
{\displaystyle dU=T\,dS-p\,dV.} {\displaystyle dU=T\,dS-p\,dV.}
%
Origins[edit]
The word enthalpy stems from the Ancient Greek verb enthalpein (ἐνθάλπειν), which means "to warm in".[4] It combines the Classical Greek prefix ἐν- en-, meaning "to put into", and the verb θάλπειν thalpein, meaning "to heat". The word enthalpy is often incorrectly attributed to Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron (1799-1864) and Rudolf Clausius through the 1850 publication of their Clausius–Clapeyron relation. This misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of The Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams. However, neither the concept, the word, nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after Clapeyron's death.
The earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875,[5] when Josiah Willard Gibbs introduced "a heat function for constant pressure". However, Gibbs did not use the word "enthalpy" in his writings.[note 1]
The actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by J. P. Dalton. According to that publication, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (1853–1926) actually coined the word.[6]
Over the years, scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy. In 1922 Alfred W. Porter proposed the symbol "H" as a standard,[7] thus finalizing the terminology still in use today.
%
For processes under constant pressure, ΔH is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the pressure-volume work that the system has done on its surroundings.[3] This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed (or released) by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume standard state: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see standard state), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25 °C.
Enthalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike entropy and Gibbs energy. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.
%
Enthalpy Listeni/ˈɛnθəlpi/ (Symbol: H) is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system. It is the thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system. It is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume.[1]
More technically, it includes the internal energy, which is the energy required to create a system, and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.[2]
Enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the variables internal energy, pressure, and volume. It is an extensive quantity. The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule, but other historical, conventional units are still in use, such as the British thermal unit and the calorie.
The enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of energy transfer. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.
The total enthalpy, H, of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, ΔH. The ΔH is a positive change in endothermic reactions, and negative in heat-releasing exothermic processes.

http://kateofgaia.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/legal-name-fraud-explained-by-kate-of-kaia.pdf
%
Before any fraud can be revealed, a simple understanding of what fraud
actually is is critical to grasp the enormity of the fraud placed on humanity
overall. Fraud is simply a knowing attempt to deceive another to steal from
them. Plain and simple, a fraud is hidden theft. What humanity is finding
difficult to accept is the actual level of theft that has been achieved over
every man, woman and child on what we call earth. Humanity has been
duped into In-dependence upon the very thing that is draining their very
souls of life and, literally, feeding it to the hounds of Hell. Not one part of
humanity's day to day activities escape this perfect net if you're still willing
to be their fishies. Every aspect of what you THINK of as a normal kinda
day is soaked and dripping in this venom that has permeated the very
mind of consciousness rendering it unconscious and thus, dead. All evil
had to do was make being dead legally, fun enough to quell and lull the
masses, and make sure you can't imagine any other kind of normal day
besides the matrix you're spinning in. I'll outline a few parables of this
during this essay where it is my hope to be able to convey, in the simplest
terms, the magnitude of this ruse while keeping your panic to a dull roar.
Yes, this is serious business since your very soul is on THEIR
lien/line/ligne until YOU un-Hook your Peter Pan and Tinkerbell but, the
answer AND truth beyond in the living reality are so simple, you simply
won't believe it.

Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
%
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?
%
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.
%
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.
%
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.
%
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.
%
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.
%
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.
%
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?
%
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?
%
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!
%
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!
%
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.
%
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?
%
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,

I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.

- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
%
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.
%
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
%
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.
%
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
%
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!
%
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!
%
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.
%
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.
%
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!
%
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!
%
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

Mangle's Gender Solved
I am here to settle this debate once and for all. We all know about the 10 page threads filled with nothing but useless statements of what mangle's gender is, with little to no evidence to back it up. Let's see what we are dealing with here. With source materiel from three games (FNaF 2, FNaF 4, FNaF World) I believe we can finally settle this. Lets take a look at all the evidence we have.
NOTE: this article will draw evidence from Mangle, Funtime Foxy, and Nightmare Mangle

Female Evidence
Pink
Lipstick
Long Eyelashes
Pink Panties
Ladies Night

Male Evidence
Bow-tie
Cheeks are Red
Descends from a Male Character (Foxy)
Phone Guy refers to as Male

The next list of evidence is rather surprising, children look away.

Homosexual Male Evidence (refer to http://i.imgur.com/el70qR9.jpg for comparisons to Adventure Toy Chica)
Some Homosexual Men try to replicate the look of a woman, while keeping some parts of their physical gender(Lipstick and Panties, Bow-tie and red cheeks) 
Funtime Foxy does not have the Atomy of a Woman (Breasts and thighs) compared to A. T. Chica
Funtime Foxy's Panties are shaped different than A. T. Chica's (it has male genitals)
Most of the time, Girl's Homosexual friends are allowed on a "Girls Night Out"
PG refers to as Male
Iris's are same size as A. T. Freddy's, But A. T. Chica's are huge
For My Last Piece of Evidence, Scott literally put it right in front of us. Nightmare Mangle comes out of the closet, need I say more?

What do you think? Have you been enlightened?

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

In the beginning there was only Julian. Julian was the quiet sort. He was quite the fan of eating caterpillars when his brother wasn’t watching. One day, Julian found a particularly large caterpillar. It had needle-like spines all along it’s back. Julian simply could not resist the temptation. As he placed the wriggling monstrosity upon his tongue, Julian felt the needle prick the roof of his mouth. As it did so, Julian felt free. No longer could his parents hold him back. No longer could his brother control him. Julian was free. And Julian was the empire of the galaxy. Julian awoke sometime later with a migraine and a peculiar desire for apples. Julian unsteadily gathered his legs beneath him, and began his ascension. Once standing, Julian decided not to eat caterpillars anymore.
One day Julian and his pal, Rufus went to the dentist together. The dentist was a big fan of Rufus’ cockroach affinity, but told Rufus to stop eating them because they would ruin his teeth. Julian told the dentist that Rufus should not worry about his cockroach eating habits and the doctor should die in a hole. The doctor approved of Julian’s sternness and gave Julian a degree. Julian was so happy to have a degree in dentistry that he quit his job as a janitor and decided to throw Rufus under the bus. Literally. Upon receiving a dentistry degree, he got a job as a dentist for one day and was promptly fired after scraping the inside layer of little Ricky’s mouth, causing him to bleed and slowly die. That was the day Julian found a love for blood and this craving led him to throw his best pal under the bus (and record it in slow motion, of course). Just two hours after he had posted this video on YouTube, he was contacted by a monk in Lithuania about his love for blood. He was invited to train with the monk in Lithuania so he could join his Magical Ministry of Hemos.

%
Khai did you write this?

ja
%
"Very good graphics?"
%
lol
%
This will scare children under 10 defininetly and has even scared adults and teenagers as seen on REACT on YouTube. It will give you some chills no matter what when you play this game. The jumpscares become more and more un predictable as you survive each night. This game does have very good graphics and a nice mystery that I eventually solved. The only thing parents should be worried about is the back story, the possessed animatronics, and the gradually unpredictable Jumpscares. If your child that is ten or under gets scared, this sometimes normal, take away the game for a little bit and show your child some YouTube videos that make the game less scary.( I should know because I tried this, the best video was by GarArt studios)

Scott still hasn't said the gender of Funtime Foxy
Yes, You heard right, Scott is still trolling us.

Night 2: "Let's give HIM a little shock"

Night 3: "(I believe) Let's make sure SHE's on her stage"

Scott is it really impossible to just say a gender for Funtime Foxy

Best Review: It´s like FNaF 1 but better and scarier!!!

Toy Freddy did Bite of 87 theory based off the paycheck
1. divide the money by the month
2. multiply the number you got in 1 with the day 
3. then divide 1987 with the number you got in 2
4. then divide 142 with the number you got in 3
5. then divide the amount of numbers by the awnser you got in 4
6. then multiply the awnser you got in 5 by the number of misc stuff(/.- ect.)
7. then divide the number of letters in the paycheck by the awnser you got in 6.



You should get 5.7998987466149 in microsoft calculater then rounded it to 6.

Now if we round the number it is 6. The 6th animatronic is Toy Freddy as seen in the costom night screen. This sort of makes sense did you see the mechinism you 
from yeah strait to the office not through vents. Notice his jaw opens reall far. Also look how when he comes in the room he has black eyes, but when he jumpscares
you his eyes are back to normal. In the hallway his eyes are open which says quite a bit so far. Now phone guy said that annimatronics must stay at there post 
at all times during the day time but get to rome at night. This debunks Foxy's evidence everyone said a girl came up to foxy and bit her,but really thats false. 
FNaF one takes place in 1993. Theres no way foxy could of done it at that certain place. Back to Freddy. So maybe when the eyes turned Black , the haunted children must of took over and took a little taste.

Get on tomorrow morning and voice chat with them and ask for chat permissions
%
You need permissions
%
I know
%
I can't talk in the German chat
%
Khai
%
Such contradiction
%
"I didn't know we were doing the ink form yet"
%
Exactly
%
Yeah
%
"Don't add knots into the layout until we add it to the code"
%
You told me to not add anything to the drawing without adding it to Ink Form!
%
...
%
I figured we would map it out, and then convert it
%
I didn't know we were doing the ink form yet
%
you added a whole book to the drawing without adding it to Ink Form!
%
I can't believe you were getting triggered at me
%
Ink Form
%
k I added a lot from the drawing to to .ink
%
shame
%
using data...
%

%
Khai
%
Don't ask
%
Also a few apples
%
ok
%
?
%
And pens
%
I have pineapples now
%
I won't
%
don't freak out
%
K
%
I'll add to the code
%
what
%
Don't add knots into the layout until we add it to the code
%
Khai
%
I made only necessary ones
%
Do not undo my changes
%
I'm offline
%
You have revision history
%
BUT UNDO
%
THEN WE'LL ADJUST IT SLIGHTLY
%
That makes it dull
%
It should not repeat
%
If it's going to do that, remove it
%
YES LOOPING BACK
%
I don't care
%
No looping back
%
it just doesn't have the option to eat more pillars
%
it loops back, sort of
%
no UNDO
%
No looping back into itself
%
Every branch needs to be 100% independent
%
WHY IS IT DASHED RED OUTLINES
%
We can't have choices that don't go anywhere
%
But it needs to be like that
%
I don't have more internet
%
Okay

LET ME FIX THEM
